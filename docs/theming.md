# Theming Guide

[Material Theming](https://material.io/go/design-theming) is the ability to
systematically customize Material Design to better reflect your product's
brand.

Once you have updated your app theme to inherit from a Material Components
theme, as discussed in the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide, you can
start to take advantage of the app-wide theming systems that are built into
Material Components for Android.

For information on the individual Material Theming systems, take a look at the
following guides:

*   [Color Theming](theming/Color.md)
*   [Typography Theming](theming/Typography.md)
*   [Shape Theming](theming/Shape.md)
*   [Motion Theming](theming/Motion.md)
